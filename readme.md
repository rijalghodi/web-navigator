# Description

This is a project challenge solved by me, proposed by codecademy.com on Front End Engineer Career Path course.

A web navigation simulation using bash terminal window. In this project, I implement my knowledge about Linear Data Structure to solve the simple problem of web navigation.
As we have already know, web navigation can be modeled by Stack, one of data structure type that widely used.
Web follows FILO rule (First In, Last Out) on managing it's navigation. The page the user open first will be the last page user
can close.

# Features

- enter a new page to be visited,
- navigate backward or forward a page, and
- to quit the program.

# How to use

- run `node script.js` on terminal window in the directory of this project
- Follow the instruction on the terminal window

# Technologies

- Javascript
- Linear Data Structure Knowlegde
